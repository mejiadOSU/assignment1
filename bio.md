Programming Background
My hobbies include working on my man cave, a small shed in my backyard, and spending time with my family. Im a father to a troublesome two year old and husband to a needy wife. =D Joking I love them both.

My favorite project in 161/162 were the games. I enjoyed making them as random as possible. Thats the only way to make them fun and a real game. Before OSU I attended a few classes at my local community college for HTML and DreamWeaver CS6. I hope these skills help me out in the class.
