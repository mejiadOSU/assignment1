Programming Background
My hobbies include working on my man cave, a small shed in my backyard, and spending time with my family. Im a father to a troublesome two year old and husband to a needy wife. =D Joking I love them both.

My favorite project in 161/162 were the games. I enjoyed making them as random as possible. Thats the only way to make them a real game.
