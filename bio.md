Programming Background
My hobbies include working on my man cave, a small shed in my backyard, and spending time with my family. Im a father to a troublesome two year old and husband to a needy wife. =D Joking I love them both.

My favorite project in 161/162 were the games. I enjoyed making them as random as possible. Thats the only way to make them a real game.

I have some experiance in HTML and DreamWeaver CS6 from some classes at my local community college. I hope it helps me out here.
